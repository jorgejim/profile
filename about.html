		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<div>
			<p class="aboutme">I'm a recent graduate from Penn State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Engineering Leadership Development. I am originally from Dominican Republic and came here to pursue my degree and now a career in it. Developing and creating software has been my passion ever since I could script programs to solve problems faster on my TI calculator in high school. Solving problems quickly, willingness to help people out and good teamwork are skills that I possess that have proven to be quite helpful in the development of my projects so far.<br>  

			Through experience from course projects I've learned to code in the most simple and understandable manner I can, even if the problem is complex; abstraction is the key to simple and pretty code. Other projects I've worked on vary from coding competitions, to hackathons to open source development for DuckDuckGo. I've learned vastly from all of these side projects and the team members with whom I pair up with to complete these within the allotted time. Doing these side projects, along with other coding challenges from online sources, has taught me to work well under fast-paced environments and build efficiently for hard deadlines.<br>

			I'm currently working on designing my own website after taking a liking for it during my last hackathon (HackPSU). I intend to have it as a constant work in progress by adding functionalities to it along with personal information regarding past and current projects. For the time being these can be accessed from my linked GitHub account.<br>

			As of now I am looking for a job that will allow me to grow as a programmer and as a professional through challenging work in a fast-paced environment. I tend to be a quick learner and believe being put in a competitive environment would yield the best results from me as I'd be consistently giving my best (and improving) work and learning the most from it.<br>
